# Assignment 1 - HTML and CSS
Create your personal website.  You need to meet the following requirements:

(1) Use HTML and CSS in your assignment. DO NOT use books and frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap).

(2) Build the document according to the HTML 5 resistance (you must not miss the DOCTYPE).

(3) Validate the page according to HTML5 and CSS3.  If you want to use properties that are not yet standardized when creating CSS, e.g. using browser prefixes (vendor prefixes), this is possible.  So these rules may not be valid.  

(4) For the page, do not use a font that is set as standard for the browser, use a different font (e.g. Roboto, Poppins, etc.).  Attach the font as a sub-subject locally.  For the purposes of this exercise, do not use a link (e.g. Google Fonts).

(5) The entire personal web page will consist of 4 subpages - "About me", "CV", "My schedule", "Interactive image".   The last sub-page can be changed by changing the actual content.   The whole page will be primarily written in Slovak with the use of diacritics.  Alternatively, you may use another language that contains a different alphabet (characters with m caps, diacritics, etc.). 

(6) Use only tags with attributes allowed by HTML5.   When defining the structure of the page, it is necessary to make maximum use of the semantic tags that HTML5 brings with it (header, footer, nav, section, article, address, ...).  You can see an example of a formless page structure in these figures.Add identifiers and classes to the page structure as needed.   

(7) Each subpage will contain the headings of two levels.

(8) Navigate the solution using an unordered list.   All links will be functional and will allow you to make connections between the created substrings. Use CSS to modify the navigation between the subpages to create a horizon below the document header.

(9) The "About Me" subpage will contain 1-2 paragraphs that will characterize you at a time.  Whether you are focusing on your personal activities or on your work at school.  Include a photo of yourself in this section.  For the image, do not forget the "alt", "height" and "width" attributes.In addition, the page will contain a single unnumbered list of the sub-items of your selection, which will be displayed vertically.   If nothing else comes to mind in the meantime, just write "I am currently studying at the FEEI STU in Bratislava and this semester I am taking the following subjects ...". In the substring, add an element <aside>, including a quote, saying, slogan or motto that is currently in use. When formatting the "About Me" sub-page, have your photo surround the text, with the photo on the front of the webpage and the text on the right side of the webpage.  Emphasize the added slogan (motto, saying, quote) (at least in a large font - see the picture above) and insert it into the text so that it fits in naturally.  In order to make the text flow, you need to have enough text.  If necessary, therefore, you want to add the missing text to the page.'

(10) The 'Biography' sub-page will be created in the form of a structured biography.  It will consist of two columns, each of which will have a different background colour (throughout, i.e. not just below the text).  In the first column there will be a photograph (it may or may not be the same as the one on the first page), - contact information with a link to the electronic way of contacting you. In the second step, the following information will be provided: - educational attainment, - communication skills, - language skills. 

(11) The subpage "My timetable" will contain the personal timetable of the faculty in the field of physical education. The schedule will look similar to the school web pages from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., except that the cells where you do not have classes will be connected and available.  If you look at the following figure, it means that there will be only 6 cells in the Monday row: 1st hour, 2-3rd hour, 4-5th hour, 6-8th hour, 9-10th hour and 11-14th hour.  Assumption ́a savyuˇuˇ use the attributes "colspan" or "rowspan". For the formats of the "My Schedule" subpage, separate the graphic header, lectures, exercises, and physical culture.  The individual lines of the quotient are also coloured, but use dynamic colour rendering
of color and non-color lines, e.g. using tr:nth-of-type. The layout must be responsive.Use CSS inheritance for graphical cell layout.

(12) The sub-page "Interactive image" will contain a photograph of the group of people (possibly explained in the exercise), where at least 5 selected areas will be highlighted, which can be clicked on, respectively clicked on with the mouse.  It must be clear from the page which areas are active.   If you download the image from somewhere on the Internet, you must also include a clickable link to the page from which you downloaded it. When you hover your mouse over an active area, display the relevant events related to your selection next to the selected area.  Graphically display this information appropriately.  This should include at least a heading and some additional text.  To achieve the required functionality, use only cascading text in the article. As the individual clickable areas resemble each other, the use of inheritance in CSS for graphical editing is the most optimal and efficient way to use it. If it is possible to inherit some features and avoid duplication, it is necessary to make some adjustments.The figure and its active areas must be adapted to a responsive display.  For smaller displays, it is possible to display the label in the centre of the screen.

(13) Do not forget the full-page layout.  The titles of the individual subpages must be changed.

(14) The information on the page must be in UTF-8 encoding.

(15) Make sure you have the following in the layout.  Do not forget to put the appearance before the image.  In this assignment, the appearance of the sana puts a lot of emphasis on the evaluation as well.  For example, you can check this athttps://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp.

(16) Note that the page, its main menu and the individual parts of the page may be displayed on different monitor sizes, i.e. i.e. the page must be responsive and should not be optimised only for the display device used by you.
